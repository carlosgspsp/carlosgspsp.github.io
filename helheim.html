							<h2>HelHeim Engine</h2>
						</header>
						<p>As one of my most significant projects, I led a team of 19 developers in the creation of the "Helheim Engine," a custom game engine built from the ground up in C++ and OpenGL. My responsibilities included implementing critical features such as in-engine shadow support, a versatile decals system for dynamic environments, comprehensive game object and scene management, a robust custom scripting system for enhanced gameplay flexibility, and an advanced Image-Based Lighting system that elevated visual fidelity.</p>
						<p> These contributions not only showcased my technical expertise and problem-solving skills but also deepened my commitment to creating engaging and polished gaming experiences. The successful completion of this project highlighted our team's innovation and ability to deliver a powerful engine capable of achieving high-quality graphics and performance.</p>

								<h3>Scene Management</h3>
								<p> Developed robust scene management techniques to efficiently load, unload, and transition between game environments, ensuring seamless gameplay experiences. Implemented an Entity Component System (ECS) architecture that allowed for flexible game object management and dynamic behavior assignment. This approach facilitated the separation of data and functionality, enhancing performance and enabling easier iteration on game mechanics.</p>

								<h3>Custom Scripting System</h3>
								<p>Designed and implemented a flexible custom scripting system using Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs), allowing for modular code development and runtime scripting capabilities. This system enabled game designers and developers to write and modify gameplay scripts without recompiling the engine, significantly enhancing workflow efficiency. The use of DLLs facilitated easy integration of new features and behaviors, empowering teams to iterate rapidly on game mechanics and ensuring a more dynamic and adaptable gameplay experience.</p>

								<h3>Image Based Lighting</h3>
								<p>Developed an advanced Image-Based Lighting (IBL) system that enhances the visual fidelity of scenes by simulating realistic lighting effects based on environment maps. This system utilized high-dynamic range (HDR) images to create dynamic reflections and ambient lighting, significantly improving the overall atmospheric quality of the game. By integrating IBL, I enabled more natural interactions between light and surfaces, allowing materials to react realistically to their surroundings. </p>

								<h3>Shadow Support</h3>
								<p>Implemented comprehensive shadow support within the "Helheim Engine" using shadow maps, enhancing the realism and depth of scenes by accurately simulating how light interacts with objects. This involved developing an efficient shadow mapping technique that provided high-quality shadows while maintaining performance. The shadow rendering system was optimized to deliver detailed shadows that adapted to dynamic lighting conditions and object movements. This feature significantly improved the visual fidelity of the game, creating a more immersive environment where players could experience realistic lighting dynamics and depth perception.</p>
